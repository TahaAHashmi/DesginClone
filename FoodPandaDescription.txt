***First Web Project***

Design clone of foodpanda.pk using vanilla CSS. 

The following must be taken into account:
    -The following project displays an acute understanding of main CSS features like flexbox, grids,
     media queries, etc.
    -Media Queries were applied based on desktop and 960px width only to display an understanding
     of the feature.
    -Minimal concerns were given to aspects like font, colors, and complete accuracy in
     terms of dimensions. Rather, the focus was on learning the intrinsic workings of CSS.
